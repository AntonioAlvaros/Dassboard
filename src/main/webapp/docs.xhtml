                <p>These response codes have been presented for your reference and are derived from the message format defined in Australian Standard 2805.2 (1997).</p>
                <p>It is highly unlikely that you will receive many of these response codes; as a general rule you should use the provided summary response code to determine whether a transaction is approved or declined. Valid response codes are of a two digit alphanumeric format.</p>
                <p>If an unknown response code is returned please contact Westpac with the appropriate transaction details.</p>
                <p>Please note that there are no response codes specific to card verification number mismatches. This is because no financial institutions within Australia currently return any such information if declining a transaction for security reasons. Response Codes are generally returned from the customer's issuing bank.</p>

              <section>
                <h1 id="credit-card-transaction-response-codes">Credit card transaction response codes</h1>
                <p>Successful credit card transactions will generally have a response code of 00 - Approved or completed successfully or 08 - Honour with Identification. Other statuses indicate a problem processing the transaction. If you receive a status code starting with 'Q' that you do not understand, you should contact your Client Enquiry Manager with the transaction details.</p>
                <p>For non approved transaction statuses that do not start with 'Q' the card holder will likely need to contact their issuing financial institution for more information about the rejected transaction. </p>
                <p>When doing so you can recommend they:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>provide the date and amount of the transaction.</li>
                  <li>request specific information regarding the transaction rejection.</li>
                </ul>

                  <li>Account does not allow Direct Debit</li>
                  <li>Incorrect Account Number</li>
